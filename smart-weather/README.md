The application provides real-time weather reports, allows users to create custom reports, and visualizes historical weather data with charts.

## Key Features

- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Backend in Java Spring Boot, frontend in React.
- **Persistent Storage:** PostgreSQL (Neon) for storing weather reports.
- **RESTful API:** CRUD operations for weather reports with proper validation.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Dockerized backend and database for consistent environment setup.
- **Data Visualization:** Display historical weather data with interactive charts.
- **Cloud-Ready:** Hosted on Back4App for easy scalability.
- **Fallback Data:** If database is empty, current weather data is displayed dynamically.
